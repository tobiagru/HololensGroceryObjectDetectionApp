# Hololens Object Detection App
This is a UWP app that runs on Hololens and performs object detection on a remote Tensorflow Extended (TFX) serving server which runs a object detection model. Can be used with REST or gRPC. gRPC + GPU server leads to near realtime performance.

This app served as a demo case for this publication: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Klaus_Fuchs2/publication/337068624_Towards_Identification_of_Packaged_Products_via_Computer_Vision_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Object_Detection_and_Image_Classification_in_Retail_Environments/links/5dc7de0692851c81803f4126/Towards-Identification-of-Packaged-Products-via-Computer-Vision-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Object-Detection-and-Image-Classification-in-Retail-Environments.pdf
